# @stealify/k8s
Components to Implement k8s with Stealify Components as also Incremental Adopt and Port k8s.

## Why?
k8s also known under many names like borg, kubernetes, docker, cloud .......
It is coded mainly using a conglomerat of bad habbits to implement a API to spawn and handle Containers via a bad secured API by Design.
Fun Fact over 30% of whole worlds Crypto Minining Capacity is arrchived via hacked k8s clusters where services get spawned in a hidden way.
I do not want to blame and say to much if your a k8s user you know what problems your facing! This solves them.

It allows you to implement k8s compatible concepts in a Secure Isolated way as also expose api's that do 1:1 map k8s functionality without the Architectural missconceptions of the current builds that lead to stuff like minik8s and minicube and you name it.
